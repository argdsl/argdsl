### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is <b>ALTER-GAMING</b>, an IOS app that loads documents that contains defined Augmented Reality games and run them using the Ipad's camera.

The AR games are defined by <b>ARGDSL</b>, a Specific-Domain Language created with Eclipse Modelling Framework and Xtext. This is a declarative, textual DSL (Domain-Specific Language) that allows customising all aspects of an AR game, including the domain elements, their graphical representation, their behaviour and the game logic. The goal of ARGDSL is to avoid the need of programming or the use of complex AR frameworks, lowering the entry barrier to AR game development.

Here you can found both projects, including the code samples of AR Games:

<ul>
  <li>Balance</li>The goal of this game is to maintain a ball balanced on a platform, avoiding its collision with an obstacle. The tilt of the platform is controlled with the accelerometer, and the goal is to keep the ball balanced for as long as possible so that it does not go off the platform. Players earn points for every second they balance, but colliding with the obstacle deducts points. After 10 seconds, the platform gets smaller, making it harder to balance. If the ball falls off, the game is over and the score is displayed

  <li>Skeet</li>The aim of this game is to shoot at targets that are in the air, using a limited amount of time and ammunition. 
Shooting is performed by clicking a button, and the player needs to orient and move the mobile device to hit the targets.
The game is won if all targets are hit within the time, and lost if there are any targets left or the player runs out of ammunition.

  <li>Labyrinth</li> The goal is to guide a ball into the green pivot without hitting the red walls, using the direction buttons. 
If the ball hits a red wall, the game is lost. When the ball reaches the pivot, the maze returns to the initial state, but 
reducing the platform and increasing the size of the walls, making the game more difficult. 
The game is won when the pivot is reached three times.

  <li>Football</li> The player has to make goals without touching any obstacle. There is time limit to make many goals as possible. Once the time limit reaches to 0, the game is over and the score is the number of goals minus the number of obstacles that had been hit
