### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is <b>ALTER-GAMING</b>, an IOS app that loads documents that contains defined Augmented Reality games and run them using the Ipad's camera.

The AR games are defined by <b>ARGDSL</b>, a Specific-Domain Language created with Eclipse Modelling Framework and Xtext. This is a declarative, textual DSL (Domain-Specific Language) that allows customising all aspects of an AR game, including the domain elements, their graphical representation, their behaviour and the game logic. The goal of ARGDSL is to avoid the need of programming or the use of complex AR frameworks, lowering the entry barrier to AR game development.

Here you can found both projects, including the code samples of AR Games specified in <a>https://alter-ar.github.io/gaming.html</a>
